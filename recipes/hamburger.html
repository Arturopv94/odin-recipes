    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Try my recipe for melt-in-your-mouth burgers that will be a hit at any cookout.</p>
    <p>Generally, I shoot for a 70/30 ratio of lean meat to fat for my diner-style burgers, but because of the added butter (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t love butter, right?), I use an 80/20 lean to fat ratio.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs ground beef 80/20 fat to lean ratio</li>
        <li>1 stick butter frozen</li>
        <li>1 medium Vidalia onion sliced</li>
        <li>14 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>buns (I use onion buns)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the fine side of a box grater, grate the butter.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and grated butter to a mixing bowl. Mix it thoroughly by hand and loosely form the patties, about 1/2″ thick. Once patties are formed, add salt and pepper. I like a generous amount of both, but use what you’re comfortable with.</li>
        <li>Preheat your flat top griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 tablespoon vegetable oil on the cooking surface and allow it to heat up for about one minute. Place onions on oil and sauté about 3 minutes before adding the burgers.</li>
        <li>Next to the onions, add remaining oil, place burgers on the hot surface, and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, depending on the burger’s thickness. I always recommend checking the internal temperature of the burger with a reliable instant read thermometer to ensure they’re safe for eating.</li>
        <li>Once the burger is flipped, place a slice of American cheese on top of each patty, then top with sautéed onions and another piece of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with a griddle dome or lid and allow the burgers to finish cooking. The dome will trap in the steam and melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>While cheese is melting, lightly baste the cut side of the bun surface with rendered fat and butter from the burger. Place the buns face down on the flat top to get them lightly toasted.</li>
        <li>Remove the buns from the cooking surface, place burger onto the bottom bun, (I normally go for a double as you can see), and top with sautéed onions and other optional toppings.</li>
    </ol>
